# 2048

The game is pretty simple, you press the left, right up or down arrow keys to move the tiles around. In one stroke all tiles shift in that direction. If two tiles are the same value, they merge and double. If you run out of moves ~ Game Over! but if you get the 2048 tile ~ You can celebrate and retreat or keep going to see how far you can go!

A key thing for me was the colors I used in this game. The game also incorporates Sound as a cue to the user that their move was valid. I have also added confirmational messages for the user if they wish to Exit/Refresh the board.

Some things that I would hope to incorporate into this game, to improve its UX/UI are:
 ~ have the tiles animated in such a way that they slide to the other side, instead of just popping up.
 ~ having new tiles pop up on the board, by growing in size at the place where they are supposed to originate.
 
Here are some screenshots from the game!
